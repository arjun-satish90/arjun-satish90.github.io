Flutter has become one of the most hyped cross platform tool since its stable release and has literally taken the mobile development sphere by a storm!!. [Flutter Plugins official repo] (https://github.com/flutter/plugins) is buzzing with activity and that is a very good sign for any new framework. That is the very idea of making a platform open source 



Lets see what qualities makes Flutter the most loved by the developer community:

1. Support for Cupertino and Material Design Philosophies: Adding support for both design philosophies out of the box has really worked well for Flutter. Most of the other frameworks             has been ignoring this important support and that is where I think flutter wins. Flutter has a lot of UI components for both cupertino and material styles and serves most use cases. Even if you need create one, that would be pretty easy compared to others

2. Draws its own Widgets and Strong widget support : Most of the cross platform framework like React native, xamarin works as a wrapper on top of native UI while Flutter draws its own widgets from scratch. Yeah, you heard it right from scratch and that means there is less mediated communication between the app and platform and that shows in its awesome performance.

3. Fast and simple development : Hot reload in Flutter which allows you to see the changes almost instantaneouly , works flawlessly and the API documentation is so good that you never get lost or get stuck in between. 

4. Compatability : Since the widget are part of the app and not on the platform you will end up facing lesser issues with regards to different platforms.

5. Open source & Community support : Both flutter and Dart are open source and they will get even better in limited time. Also there is an awesome community out there building great plugins and support you when you encounter any issues


Still not convinced ? They have support for multiple platforms like Windows,MacOSX, linux, Web and they are firing up in Beta now. So grab you keyboard and start coding in Flutter.
